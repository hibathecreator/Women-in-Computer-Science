      <h3>Barbara Liskov</h3>
      <p> Liskov was born in Los Angeles, Calafornia. She got a bachelors in mathematics at the University of California and was one of the first women to get a PHD in Computer Science at MIT. Then, she worked at the Mitre Corporation where she developed the Venus operating system which would be used to develop more complex software. After completing her experiments with this system, she joined MIT as a professor in the Laboratory of Computer Science.  There she developed the CLU programming language which emphasized less cluttered and more objective coding which laid the foundation of Javascript and C++.  Later on her team at MIT also made the ARGUS language which made it easier to distribute programs across a network. She later researched computation and operating systems while greatly contributing to online databases. She improved code by making it such that it operated with malfunctioned components and by making it more clear and concise. She became a professor at MIT in 1980 and is currently serving as a professor of Engineering there. She has also served as the head of the department of Computer Science and has been named Institute Professor. In 2008, Liskov won the Turing Award for her innovations. She has earned countless awards throughout her life like the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Lifetime Achievement Award (2008) and Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award (1996). She has also researched AI and is currently researching that at MIT.
