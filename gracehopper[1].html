        <h3> Grace Hopper</h3>
        <p>Grace Murry Hopper was born on December 6, 1906 in New York City, NY. In 1934, she graduated from Yale University with a PHD in Mathematics. In 1943, she joined the Navy WAVES for World War II. In 1944, she was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University where she helped design the Mark 1 computer which was the first digital computer in the US. She later worked on the Mark II and Mark III computer and researched at Harvard afterward. In 1949, she was removed from her position as a computer programmer at Harvard after the end of World War II because of her gender. That year she accepted a position at Eckert-Mauchly Computer company as a senior mathematician. There, she developed the concept of a compiler which makes coding much simpler by converting binary code into code instructions in english. Her first compiler was called F-O or “Flow Matic” and it was used to code the UNIVAC I and II computers which were the first computers made open to the public. This compiler led to the development of the first universal coding language called COBOL which was used worldwide in all fields and cooperations. She continued working as a researcher for the navy, standardized the coding system, and educated thousands of people on compilers and computer programming. She was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1991, the Computer Science Man of the Year Award in 1969, 40 doctoral awards, and many military awards like the Naval Ordnance Development Award.
