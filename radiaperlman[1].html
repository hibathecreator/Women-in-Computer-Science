        <h3>Radia Perlman</h3>
        <p>Perlman was born in 1952 in Portsmouth, Virginia. In 1976, she graduated with a masters in mathematics and started working for Bolt, Berenek, Newman (BBN), a company that developed software for the networks. In 1980, she was hired by the Digital company who had been trying to develop a way in which computers can safely share information. Perlman addressed this problem by making the Spanning Tree Protocol(STP) which transformed ethernet by allowing it to connect multiple computers at once and to share information with them without a CD/wire. This allowed for information to be easily transferred from one computer to another which was a key component in the development of the internet. In 1988, Perlman got her PHD in computer science from MIT. She wrote two books called “Interconnections: Bridges, Routers, Switches, and Internetworking Protocols”; and “Network Security: Private Communication in a Public World” which guides internet connection and network safety even today. In 1977, she joined Sun Microsystems where she continued improving the STP through her TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) project. She was a professor at Harvard University and the University of Washington. Throughout her life, she received over 80 patents and awards for her talent in the field of Computer Science. <br>
            Interesting Fact:
          Perlman greatly dislikes being called the “Mother of Internet” even though her work laid the groundwork for the entire system. In an interview with the Atlantic magazine, she wrote:<br>
          “The Internet was not invented by any individual. There are lots of people who like to take credit for it...I did indeed make some fundamental contributions to the underlying infrastructure, but no single technology really caused the Internet to succeed.” <br>
          She wants to emphasize the work of others and the contributions they made in order to create the internet. That’s why she doesn’t want to be called the “mother of the internet”.
