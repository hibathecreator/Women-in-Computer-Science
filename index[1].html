      <p><h4>Women in Programming(1940s-1980s)</h4>
      <p>After men went off to war in World War II(1939-1945) women got higher degrees of freedom as they started pursuing their education and getting jobs. Many became mathematicians and then were assigned jobs to find the angles at which trajectories have to be launched in order to hit their target. These tasks were painstaking and often took months to complete. Therefore, in 1944, Howard Aiken built the Harvard Mark 1 computer, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, which would be programmed to solve difficult mathematical problems in a few seconds. He assigned this task to a group of programmers and among them was Grace Murry Hopper. Hopper helped lead the team and eventually developed the necessary software, which served as the foundations for all modern computers. Then, in 1946, the ENIAC( Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was introduced as the first general purpose digital computer. It was proposed by physicist John Machuly who then hired a team of six women to develop the software for the machine.These women were:  Jean Jennings Bartik, Frances Elizabeth “Betty” Holberton, Frances Bilas Spence, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Kathleen “Kay” McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, and Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum. For two and a half years they sought to find the solution and eventually they created the fastest digital calculator made up till that point. Eventually the Mark 2 and Mark 3 computers were introduced in 1947 and 1950 respectively. Eventually Grace Hopper developed the COBOL programming language which converted the complex binary system fed into computers into a simpler language that could be used by more citizens. Hopper then worked on the UNIVAC computer which was released in 1951 and became the first commercially sold computer. In 1961, Mary Allen Wilkes helped program the LINC which became the first personal computer. In 1975, Barbara Liskov, a mathematician helped develop the CLU programming language which laid the foundation for JavaScript and C++ as used today. In 1985, Radia Perlman developed the Spanning-Tree-Protocol(STP) which helped develop the concept of ethernet and eventually lead to the invention of the internet. This protocol allowed for information to be safely transmitted from one computer to another. This discovery was crucial because it helped create the World Wide Web.

      <h4>Women in Programming(1980s-2010s)</h4>
      <p>In 1953, Elsie Shutt, a computer programmer, told Janet Abbate, a tech historian, that the programming workforce consisted of 50% men and 50% women. In 1967, a Cosmopolitan magazine published an article called “The Computer Girls” which showed images of women working on the control deck of the USS Enterprise. However, after 1984, the number of women graduating with degrees in computer science started decreasing from 37.1% in 1984 to only 17% in 2010. Studies discovered that the reason for this decline was caused by the introduction of personal computers into homes in the 1970s and 1980s. These computers were expensive devices and because of societal norms, males were more often exposed to computers than females who were instead encouraged to practice fidelity. Therefore, when male students participated in computer science classes in college, they already had much more experience than the females in the major. In the past, almost all students arrived at college with no experience of coding. Now, females started feeling less confident in their abilities and they were further discouraged by changing views which depicted that a student must be really experienced in coding in order to ever think of becoming a real programmer. Many women stopped Computer Science as a career or dropped out when they lost hope of ever catching up to their more experienced male classmates. These results were gathered by Jane Margolis, a social scientist, and then published in a New York Times article. 
      <br>
      Though less than 10% of graduating computer scientists are women, many women continue to persevere in this field despite the great social challenges they face along the way. One example is Marissa Mayer, who got a masters in Computer Science. She then became the 20th employee at Google and the first female engineer there. She then helped supervise the production of many Google Products and became the CEO of Yahoo. Another example is Katherine Johnson, a mathematician who helped make the software and calculations necessary for the success of the Apollo 11 moon landing.
      <br>
      Most of the women mentioned on this website weren’t acknowledged for their accomplishments until the 21st century. In the past, men who funded projects or built it took credit making the project without giving credit to the women responsible for developing the software. 
      Many other female heros are out there waiting to be discovered and praised for their work!
