      <h3>The ENIAC Computer Programmers</h3>
      <p>In the same time period as Grace Hopper, six brilliant women were programming a machine that would serve as the foundation for all future computer. <br>
      During World War II, men were away at war and so women started working and taking the positions of men. Many graduated with degrees in Mathematics because that allowed them to become mathematicians who solved trajectory problems in order to determine what angle they must launch their missile/ bullet in order to hit the target. These problems had to consider many factors and so they often took months to solve. So, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert designed a computer called ENIAC, or Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer for whom they hired six women to develop the software. This team of women included Jean Jennings Bartik, who would later lead the development of computer storage and memory, and Frances Elizabeth “Betty” Holberton, who would go on to create the first software application. Along with them were Frances Bilas Spence, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Kathleen “Kay” McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, and Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum. These women later became known as the first computer programmers.
