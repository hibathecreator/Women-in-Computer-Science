        <h3> Mary Allen Wilkes</h3>
        <p> Born on September 25, 1937 in Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 with a degree in philosophy. On the day of her graduation, Wilkes got a job as a computer programmer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology( M.I.T) due to her skill in symbolic logic. She started working on the IBM-70 which required assembly language in order to transmit information. In 1961 she started working on the LINC which was the worldâ€™s first computer which made computers more accessible to programmers. For two and a half years, Wilkes worked with a group of programmers at Lincoln Labs in order to develop the software that would allow users to control the computer interface. Eventually her team developed the code for personal computers that were being used by women like Margaret Hamilton who worked on the software development for Apollo 11 in the late 1960s. She later pursued a career as a lawyer and has recently retired. </p>
